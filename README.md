# RL_project-Hindsight-Goal-Ranking-for-Pick-and-Place-tasks

The goal of this project is to implement and evaluate a reinforcement learning
(RL) approach using Hindsight Goal Ranking (HGR) in the context of sparse
reward environments. The approach will be applied to a fixed-base manipulator
performing a pick-and-place operation in simulation. The experiments will be
conducted using the OpenAI Gym Fetch environment.
